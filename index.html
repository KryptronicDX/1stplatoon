				<p><strong>
					Welcome to 1st Platoon, recruit. You'll find the Wolverines are a fierce, 
					but friendly bunch. We're a gaming clan formed around the Arma 3 Vietnam mod, 
					Unsung. We're much more than jungle humpers. Besides our WWII campaigns 
					in Arma, we're into other games as well. Think you can fit in with this group 
					of degenerates? Join us in our Discord below if you think you can keep up.
				</strong></p>

				<br /><br />

				<p><strong>
					Recruiting to the platoon is currently open.  Upon joining our Discord, read the 
					<span style="text-decoration:underline">#welcome-to-1st-platoon</span> channel for 
					all the information to join in an operation, the mods you'll need to download, and 
					how to setup Task Force Radio.  When you're ready to go, post in the 
					<span style="text-decoration:underline">#public-lobby</span> room to sign up for 
					Orientation Training and introduce yourself.

					<h4>Weekly Operations Schedule</h4>
					<p class="black">
						Our operations are scheduled on Sundays, starting at 16:00 UK/11:00 US Eastern. This is when the
						operation starts and the platoon moves out.  To be fully kitted out and ready to go, we request
						all members to join <span style="font-style: italic">at least</span> 20 minutes early.
					</p>
					<h4>Monthly Orientation Schedule</h4>
					<p class="black">
						Orientation training is scheduled on the last Saturday of each month, starting at 16:00 UK/11:00 
						US Eastern.  As with our operations, this is when orientation starts.  <strong>All recruits need 
						to join at least 30 minutes early.</strong>  This allows for time to resolve any potential issues 
						with mod setup or joining the server.  Join Teamspeak to get started on orientation day.
					</p>
					<h4>Speciality Training</h4>
					<p class="black">
						We also provide occassional training sessions on Saturdays, starting at the same time as 
						Orientation.  Example training sessions include jump school or recon school.  As with 
						operations, you'll need to join <span style="font-style: italic">at least</span> 20 minutes 
						early.

					<h2>Sargent's Impatient Responses (FAQs)</h2>
					<h4>I want to be a pilot, I fly all the time with my bros!</h4>
					<p class="black">
						Hell no!  What type of operation do you think we run here?  You really thing we just let any 
						G.I. Joe off the street take off in one of our birds?  Do you really expect a private like you
						will be promoted to an officer just because you asked!?  Get back in line private!  You're a 
						rifleman until you're trained up, and maybe we'll allow you the privilege of attending flight 
						school! 					
					</p>
					<h4>What mods are you running?  What do I need to setup?</h4>
					<p class="black">
						That's good private, now you're asking the right questions!  When you first jump into Discord, 
						make sure you read all that's written down in #welcome-to-1st-platoon.  In there, you'll learn 
						all about this unit, and the mods and apps you'll need.  Oh, make sure you read the rules.  
						They're the first thing you see, but will be a one way ticket out if you break them.
					</p>
					<h4>What kit should I setup for operations?  Can I be a sniper?</h4>
					<p class="black">
						Hold up there private, do I need to take you back to question 1?  For your operations loadout 
						you'll need to make sure to check on the #weekly-loadout channel in Discord.  It'll all be 
						posted there.  Since you're new, you'll also be setup with the loadout when you attend the 
						orientation training.  You did read that above, right?  As a private, you'll start as a rifleman. 
						You need training and build up trust with your Sargents before you're trusted with our speciality 
						roles.  Not to mention attending our operations every week for a specialized role.
					</p>
					<h4>Sarge, I just saw the enemy over the ridge, requesting permission to go after them!?</h4>
					<p class="black">
						Denied private!  We in 1st Platoon don't tolate that lone wolf soldier here.  If you run off, 
						not only are you going to be KIA, you're letting your squad down by being one less rifleman on 
						the line.  If you repeat that maneuver, you'll be kicked out of the unit with a dishonorable 
						discharge.
					</p>
					<h4>I play ARMA with another group, can I still participate?</h4>
					<p class="black">
						Yes you can.  It doesn't matter to us who you play with on your liberty time.  As long as you're 
						kitted up and in-line for Sunday's op, you're good to go.
